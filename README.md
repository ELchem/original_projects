<b>Original Coding Projects</b><br>
<br>
<b>Encoding Project(C):</b> <br>
A variant of a Huffman encoder which encodes words and characters rather than just characters for a smaller compression size.<br>
<br>
<b>Balance Chemical Equations(Python):</b><br>
Takes an unbalanced chemical equation (eg. H2 + O2 = H2O) and converts it into a balanced formula (eg. 2H2 + O2 = 2H2O) for any chemical reation.<br>
<br>
<b>Determine Symmetry(Python):</b><br>
Takes in a 2D array and determines several of its symmetry characteristics (ie. is the array symmetrical across its middle row or column, or across on of the arrays diagonals?)<br>
